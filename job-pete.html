            <p class = "aboutp">I ended up getting kicked out of school for it. I really don't miss school that much.</p>
            
            <p class = "aboutp">I still went on to be a baking chef for a local bakery shop. My mom was very proud of me still after all that had happened.</p>
            
            <p class = "aboutp">I enjoy desserts way more than regular food. My favorite food and dessert will be posted below. I will also post the foods I don't like as well.</p>
